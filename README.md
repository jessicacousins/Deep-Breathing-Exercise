# Deep Breathing Exercise

**Description:** Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript a dynamic webpage displays a ball moving up and down. It describes a breathing exercise of pacing your breathing while following the ball that is changing color as it moves. Outside resources are hyperlinked. The ball is animated by JavaScript and hue rotation is CSS.

**Roadmap:** These files will be updated over time as skills develop.
